# Volodymyr Voiko - Software Engineer

Mobile developer at heart and a software engineer by profession. Over the past 10 years, I've engaged in diverse projects utilizing various tech stacks, working across different environments and with diverse teams. I've built a strong foundation with the Android platform, mastered mobile development within the iOS ecosystem, and even developed a Ktor backend for a significant educational platform. My experience spans hardware integration, UI design, database management, API development, SDK creation, and various services.

While my primary focus is the Apple 🍏 ecosystem, I possess a strong background in Android and Kotlin Multiplatform. I am always eager to learn new aspects of mobile application development. However, I still prefer Swift 😄.
