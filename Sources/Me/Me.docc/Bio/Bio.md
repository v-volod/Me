## Overview

I started my development journey in late 2014. While studying for my <doc:Bachelor>’s in Computer Software Engineering at [Zaporizhzhya State University](https://www.znu.edu.ua/frontpage/3594.eng.html), I became interested in Java and, as a result, focused on the then-growing Android development domain. I worked on several university projects and started freelancing, which gave me my first experience in customer communication and product delivery. While the work wasn't overly complex, it built a solid foundation for my career.

In February 2016, I began looking for a role that offered team-based experience and joined a local outsourcing company, <doc:RNC>, as a Junior Android Developer. This was my first professional milestone. It provided my first real-world experience with technical interviews, team collaboration, project management, and salary negotiations. Beyond the technical growth, I had the opportunity to work with great people and establish a strong professional trajectory.

In July 2016, I joined another outsourcing company, <doc:Pixel>. Here, I was the first mobile dev in the company 😃. That was a new direction for them, and I started the journey of mobile development. I participated in customer interviews and project estimations. Since I joined the company, I worked on a few Android projects and, after some client success, started extending the mobile development direction by learning iOS as well. In parallel, I started interviewing and building a mobile department, which grew from just me up to 8 mobile devs (50/50 iOS). Quite quickly, I learned iOS and started doing both at once. So, this milestone of my career was about learning a lot of new things and achieving new skills. After 4 years, I started feeling that I was burning out. Then COVID happened and we all moved to remote work. That triggered me to change companies to get some fresh air remotely.

In June 2020, I joined <doc:Snapp> as an iOS developer! I wanted to try focusing on a single platform to be better at one thing instead of knowing everything and nothing. That was really a breath of fresh air! Different culture. Better projects. Great work-life balance. I met a lot of good people. Learned a lot of new things—both technical skills and soft skills. I have been working on different projects with different tech stacks and business areas such as <doc:PwC> (PwC), <doc:GamesWorkshop> (Games Workshop), <doc:Bosch> (Bosch), and more. I opened the open-source direction by building a library, <doc:SnappTheming>, that simplifies the adoption of design updates in iOS projects. I worked a bit on the <doc:SnappAutomotive> companion app and toyed a bit with KMP Compose and its integration into an iOS app. In 2025, I had to work on some non-iOS related work. I developed a new backend in Kotlin for <doc:QS>. It was a tough year and, unfortunately, I had to leave <doc:Snapp> by its end.

In 2026, I am open to new possibilities again.  So, in case you want [your Company](https://your.company.domain) to be listed here in my bio, just write an [📩 email](mailto:vvoiko@icloud.com) to me, or contact me via any other sources listed below.
