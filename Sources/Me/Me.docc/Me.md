Software Engineer, primarily Mobile 📱 (iOS 🍎, Ex-Android 🤖)

## Overview

My name is Volodymyr Voiko, and I am a mobile developer at heart and a software engineer by profession. Over the past 10 years, I've engaged in diverse projects utilizing various tech stacks, working across different environments and with diverse teams. I've built a strong foundation with the Android platform, mastered mobile development within the iOS ecosystem, and even developed a Ktor backend for a significant educational platform. My experience spans hardware integration, UI design, database management, API development, SDK creation, and various services.

While my primary focus is the Apple 🍏 ecosystem, I possess a strong background in Android and Kotlin Multiplatform. I am always eager to learn new aspects of mobile application development. However, I still prefer Swift 😄.

I am open to new possibilities. Write an [📩 email](mailto:mail@voiko.dev) to me, or connect at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vvoiko/).
